# ReAct SQL — Project Hero Image Prompt (for nano-banana)

## Prompt

A clean, minimal tech illustration on a dark navy-blue background. In the center, a glowing terminal window displays a natural-language question "How many concerts had more than 500 attendees?" with a soft neon-green glow. Below the question, a stylized SQL query `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM concert WHERE attendees > 500` fades in with a subtle typing animation feel. Around the terminal, three abstract floating icons orbit gently: a brain emoji (🧠) representing the ReAct reasoning loop, a database cylinder (🗄️), and a sparkle (✨) for LLM intelligence. A thin circular arrow connects brain → database → sparkle → brain, hinting at the iterative ReAct cycle. The overall mood is futuristic, developer-friendly, and elegant. No text other than the question and SQL. Flat design, no 3D, no gradients — just clean lines and soft glows. Aspect ratio 16:9.

## Style Notes

- **Palette**: Dark navy (#0d1117), neon green (#39d353), soft blue (#58a6ff), white text
- **Feel**: GitHub-dark-theme aesthetic, clean and modern
- **No**: Busy diagrams, architecture boxes, flowchart arrows, or corporate clip-art
- **Yes**: Minimalist, developer-centric, one clear focal point (the question → SQL transformation)
